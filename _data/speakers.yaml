  title: "KEYNOTE: Iterative Enterprise SRE Transformation"
  abstract: |
    It’s easy to get discouraged reading books about industry best practices that say things like “always test in prod!” and “10 deploys a day!!” At times, they can make the goal of being a high-functioning DevOps organization feel out-of-reach for large enterprises, where changes to the way we operate take time to roll out. A few years ago, Vanguard started its journey to adopt Site Reliability Engineering across the IT division, and that transformation effort is still underway today. In this talk, we will share where we started, how far we’ve come since then, and all of the steps we’ve taken along the way, as we’ve worked to evangelize changes to the way we measure availability, enable experimentation, leverage highly-available architecture patterns, and learn from failure.

    In this presentation, we’ll focus primarily on the topic of how we monitor and measure availability - developing SLIs and SLOs, managing an error budget, leveraging Honeycomb for observability. We’ll also touch on other aspects of our SRE transformation at a higher level, including home-grown tools for self-service chaos engineering, self-service load testing, emerging cloud platforms (including serverless), proactive failure modes and effects analysis, and blameless post-incident reviews.

  title: "Service Level Observability: Measuring Internal States with SLOs"
  abstract: |
    Observability and SLOs have aligned goals: to better understand your systems. While the former uses externalized data to understand internal states and the later focuses on the user experience, it turns out these are almost the same thing. Observe better with SLOs and SLO better with observability.

    In 2021 there are few terms that see as much excitement in the tech world as “observability” and “service level objectives.” Unfortunately most of this is the work of marketing departments who don’t really understand either. In this talk I’ll outline what observability actually means starting with the term’s roots in control theory, talk about the origins of reliability engineering going back to the 1940s, and then describe modern and practical approaches for how observability and reliability engineering can be used for complex computer systems via better telemetry and service level objectives.

    I’m a Principal Engineer at Skyscanner currently working on improving our observability to make sure travellers get a reliable and performant experience, and passionate about OpenTelemetry as way to rethink how we instrument our applications based on open standards. Previously, my focus was on performance and resource optimisation, from the browser to our Kubernetes clusters and through our CDN and AWS infrastructure. I joined Skyscanner in 2018, following the acquisition of SKIPJAQ, an automatic ML-based optimisation startup I became a part of when I moved to London. Before moving to London I worked at CERN, in Geneva, building a DB on demand system to automatically provision and manage open-source DB systems.

    I’m passionate about travelling and experiencing new cultures, reason I went travelling around the world for months before moving London, and a possibly a factor of why I like working at Skyscanner. When I want to relax, I don’t think there’s a better way than going into the studio and playing drums for hours.

  title: How to transparently migrate 300+ services to OpenTelemetry
  abstract: |
    In this talk, I want to share some details of how tracing is implemented and auto-configured at Skyscanner via common config libraries, and how this allowed us to easily migrate from X-Ray to OpenTracing and Lightstep years ago, and now allowed us to transparently migrate to OpenTelemetry with zero impact on tracing or context propagation, and with minimal developer effort.

    At Skyscanner, we have over 300 services written in Java, Node and Python which were previously exporting spans to Lightstep Satellites and propagating trace context with OT HTTP headers. Migrating to OpenTelemetry presented a few challenges, like minimising our asks from service owners, or making sure that context could still be propagated between services that had migrated and services that hadn’t. Combining the use of OpenTracing shims, multiple trace context propagators, and OpenTelemetry Collectors, we managed to execute this migration giving engineers a minimal friction migration path.

    Migrating to OpenTelemetry paved the way to multiple improvements in our instrumentation libraries, which can now benefit from well-supported auto-instrumentation and future-proof APIs while remaining vendor agnostic.

  title: Sampling in Distributed Tracing
  abstract: |
    Sampling is still one of the biggest challenges in distributed tracing. While the basic concept is easy to grasp, the number of choices and their trade-offs requires learning about the techniques and your own workload. In this session, we are giving you all the knowledge required to master the sampling techniques: we’ll talk about head and tail-based sampling, as well as adaptive sampling, and we’ll wrap it up with a bonus discussion on trace aggregation. You’ll leave this session ready to implement scenarios, from the simple “probabilistic head-sampling” up to the complex “scalable tail-based sampling” using open source tools like OpenTelemetry Collector.

  title: Pragmatic Observability While Your Business Grows 300%
  abstract: |
    Wouldn’t it be great if the world stopped for us to implement observability the right way with ubiquitous adoption of the perfect instrumentation? Hate to break it to you, but the reality is that will never happen.

    Engineers ship code, customers use software in unintended ways, teams don’t always buy into everything, and the world will rapidly shift under your well planned roadmaps. So how do you build what you need while remaining agile to pivots that will inevitably come down the pipe? What does evangelism of new processes or tooling look like when teams are plagued with emergent demands on a daily basis? How do you get internal support for the ideas you know will change the game with an endless expectation backlog for feature delivery?

    I’ll be reviewing our strategy for pragmatic observability at H-E-B Digital, what has worked, what didn’t, and what we’re trying right now while we explosively grow our curbside and home delivery grocery business by billions during this incredibly tumultuous time in our industry and world. You’ll take away tips & tricks for building influence and internal confidence for new approaches to solving reliability problems, hopefully relate to some entertaining stories, but most importantly you might just save yourself from making some of the same mistakes I did when implementing and driving adoption of modern observability patterns in your own organization’s journey.

  title: Betting on Observability at Simplebet
  abstract: |
    Adopting Observability can be an organizational challenge. At Simplebet, we introduced Open Telemetry and o11y successfully, then published a Case-Study on our experience with Lightstep. We will share our experience gaining traction so that you can learn how to introduce o11y at your company.

    Simplebet introduced its first products into the market in 2020, which required a shift in organizational thinking around software deployments, operations, scale, etc. As we geared up for our first public launch, we needed to overcome the challenges of scaling a backend to support thousands of concurrent users at the onset. With the experience of team members who work on the Erlang Observability Working Group, we made a case for introducing distributed tracing with Lightstep as a tool to help us scale. After the first team adopted Otel and made use of distributed tracing, we mechanically implemented the same strategy to other teams in our organization. Through this instrumentation, we were able to isolate performance-critical operations, build evidence for long-standing issues, and change the way the team thought about our production system.

    This talk will spend time talking about this experience but spend the majority of the time offering practical guidance for how a developer can gain traction with o11y and Otel at their organization.

  title: Supercharge Legacy Application Logs by Injecting OpenTelemetry Span Context
  abstract: |
    A good cook uses ingredients they have in the kitchen, and observability is no different. A good practitioner should leverage legacy telemetry, even when adopting OpenTelemetry. Learn how to leverage and correlate existing application logs with OTEL Traces by injecting Span Context into your logs.

    Unlike neatly packaged demos and “Getting Started” guides, the average user of OpenTelemetry isn’t coming to the project with a complete greenfield. Instead, many of these projects are so-called “brownfields”, with existing metrics, tracing, and logs from a variety of different standards already being emitted by their Applications and used to monitor, debug, and introspect applications. OpenTelemetry, with Tracing Specification(and many SDKs) at 1.0, has done an admirable job ensuring compatibility with older tracing standards, and OpenTelemetry Metrics seem well on their way to ensuring the same broad level of support and inclusivity for existing standards. But existing Logs have been left out in the cold, to some extent, with no standard out of the box way to connect them to your traces across languages.

    But, fear not! With a bit of application code, the OpenTelemetry Language SDKs, and some willingness to monkeypatch a library or two, the ability to connect your existing Application Logs with the context of the Span and Trace Telemetry data is easier than ever. In this talk, I’ll take a survey of a few languages (Ruby, Python, and JS), and demonstrate from start to finish how to modify popular Logging Libraries to ensure that every Log line also contains the right span and trace identifiers to correlate them in your vendor or open source backend of choice. I’ll also walk through a scenario or two where connecting Logs and Traces helps improve an end users ability to debug, troubleshoot, and gain insight into their application behavior.

  title: Building and running a world-class observability function
  abstract: |
    "Observability teams as a centralized function within SRE or IT Operations are a relatively recent phenomenon. These teams are responsible for managing the monitoring and observability toolset and empowering developer and engineering teams to push the right data into the systems to get back the information they need. Central observability teams must walk a fine line between controlling cardinality and cost associated with data growth while also providing a complete dataset for quick troubleshooting and diagnostics.

    This session will explore the people and process side of observability with lessons learned from the community, including:

    * **Internal KPIs and metrics:** how do you measure the success of your observability practice?

    * **Tagging best practices:** how to get tags and labels under control and working to your advantage?

    * **Taming cardinality:** What processes can help keep cardinality under control?

    * **Roles and responsibilities:** Who is responsible for running centralized observability functions? How do you know you need a dedicated team and how many people should be on it?

    * **Centralized vs distributed teams:** How to manage the balance between individual service teams unique requirements and the need for a centralized and consistent view for SREs."
