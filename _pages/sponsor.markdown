# Why Sponsor o11yfest?

As an emerging industry of critical players in the distributed systems observability space, your financial support and direct engagement with the OpenTelemetry community exposes both you and them to your brand. For sponsors who already actively contribute to open source projects, an active presence at this event demonstrates your leadership in this industry to key practitioners and investors. For more information, email [organizers @ o11yfest.org](/contact)

This year, we are targeting between 500-1000 attendees. Your help to socialize the event will increase this further.

# Premiere Sponsorship Details

Aside from the above perks, organizers also welcome discussion on the following virtual-friendly options:

- Stickers or one small schwag-bag item which will be included and sent to attendees that opt in to receiving a bag via postal mailing address
- Hands-on booth setup assistance with an organizer and tailoring capabilities available before the event
- Collaboration and synchronization of social media shares related to the conference sponsorship
- Activity planning for the "25min booth swarming event"*

***NOTE:*** "Booth Swarm": between stage presentations, the conference will encourage all attendees to "swarm" your booth for a short period of time once during the event. Organizers highly recommend that you have more than 4 people from your company/organization actively involved in the booth at that time, either doing demos, handling breakout topic conversations, and working it hard in the chat. Many virtual conferences in 2020 suffered from a lack of virtual engagement plan such as those that exist for physical events. o11yfest organizers have decided on "swarming" as a unique way to make sure that premiere sponsors and conference attendees engage meaningfully at least once during the conference.

# Contributor Sponsorship Details

In keeping with the spirit and values of the conference, sponsors who donate a minimum total of $2,000 USD to one or more organizer-approved charities and causes also receive a subset of perks. This option encourages for-profit organizations to directly and positively support underrepresented communities.

Suggested Donation Beneficiaries:

- Trans Lifeline
- Black Girls Code
- YearUp
- Resilient Coders
- Feeding America: US Hunger Relief Organization
- Get Us PPE – Personal Protective Equipment to those who need it most
- KodeConnect

If you have alternative non-profit charities or causes you would like to suggest, please ask the organizers to review and approve it for inclusion into this list BEFORE donating. Donations that occur before engaging the event organizers cannot be retroactively counted towards a sponsorship since the event is encouraging net-new donation revenue.
Questions?

All questions can be emailed to [organizers @ o11yfest.org](/contact) and depending on the nature of the question, organizers can be scheduled for a brief face-to-face virtual chat upon request.
