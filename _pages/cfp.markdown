# CFP Closed March 15th, but ...

Our CFP for o11yfest 2021 closed March 15th, and our organizers are finalizing
 acceptances by Monday, March 22nd.

However, due to the overwhelming response for CFPs this year, the organizers are
 considering a more continuous program of smaller events (e.g. meetups, etc.)
 where these and future submissions would make sense to schedule.

The best thing to do for now is to attend o11yfest 2021 on May 17-18 and join our
 community for some great conversations and connections!
