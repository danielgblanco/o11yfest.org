# About the Conference

**o11yfest** is a two-day virtual technology conference focused on empowering DevOps practitioners with solutions that improve observability over systems and processes. It will be held online using a online platform on May 17th & 18th 2021.

o11yfest, previously held as Observe 20/20, is in its second year of operation as a grass-roots event whose aim is to encourage sharing of knowledge and development of the discipline of observability engineering.

100% of net ticket sales and contributor sponsorships will go to good causes [(read more here)](/efforts).
